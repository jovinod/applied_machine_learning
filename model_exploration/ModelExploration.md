## Framework for exploring a modelling technique
Below mentioned is an exhaustive list of the parameters that you should take into account while trying to explore and understand any 
modelling technique or machine learning algorithm.

| Parameter | Description | Import to Ask |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|

| Supervised or Un-supervised | <ul><li>Supervised models are trained on a labelled data set to make a prediction (quantitative or categorical)</li><li>Un-supervised models help understand the structure of the data without any prior information or training</li></ul> | <ul><li>Does the model need to predict an outcome or understand the structure of data?</li><li>What is the data required for training of this model?</li><li>What parameters this model is trained for, that will be used for prediction?</li></ul> |
| Descriptive or Discriminative | <ul><li>Discriminative models are a function of differentiating 2 or more classes (Linear Discriminant Analysis)</li><li>Descriptive models on the other hand help understand the process of generating the data (e.g. Gaussian Mixture Model)</li></ul> | <ul><li>Is the functional form based on generative or discriminative principle?</li><li>What is the function used for generating or discriminating the data points?</li><li>On what data types would the functional form work (e.g. linear, quadratic etc.)</li></ul> |
