## Framework for exploring a modelling technique
Below mentioned is an exhaustive list of the parameters that you should take into account while trying to explore and understand any 
modelling technique or machine learning algorithm.

| Parameter | Description | Import to Ask |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Non-Parametric or Functional | <ul><li>Model can be expressed in a functional form as Linear Regression, which is a linear function of the parameters</li><li>Parametric model are dependent on the data and are always computed based on the available data</li></ul> | <ul><li>What is the functional form of my model?</li><li>How does it appear in a 2D or 3D representation based on a sample of available data?</li><li>What are the constraints that apply to this form?</li></ul> |
| Supervised or Un-supervised | <ul><li>Supervised models are trained on a labelled data set to make a prediction (quantitative or categorical)</li><li>Un-supervised models help understand the structure of the data without any prior information or training</li></ul> | <ul><li>Does the model need to predict an outcome or understand the structure of data?</li><li>What is the data required for training of this model?</li><li>What parameters this model is trained for, that will be used for prediction?</li></ul> |
| Descriptive or Discriminative | <ul><li>Discriminative models are a function of differentiating 2 or more classes (Linear Discriminant Analysis)</li><li>Descriptive models on the other hand help understand the process of generating the data (e.g. Gaussian Mixture Model)</li></ul> | <ul><li>Is the functional form based on generative or discriminative principle?</li><li>What is the function used for generating or discriminating the data points?</li><li>On what data types would the functional form work (e.g. linear, quadratic etc.)</li></ul> |
| Pattern Recognition or Classification or Clustering or Recommendation or Density Estimation | <ul><li>Beyond the above mentioned types of model, there is another dimension to group these models based on the scenario applicability. For an example Density Estimation can be used for both classification as well as anomaly detection</li></ul> | <ul><li>What is applicability of this model?</li><li>What historical evidences are available of usage of this model?</li><li>Is it the most popular and widely used model in its's class?</li></ul> |
| Data or Parameter or Hyper-parameter | <ul><li>Data as the name suggests is the observation captured in the system either for training or understanding the structure</li><li>Parameter is the value that the model tries to identify during the optimization phase using the input data. Parameters are super critical component of the final model identified. E.g. in case of linear regression these are the Betas, identified based on the input data</li><li>Hyper-parameter are the external inputs provided to the model during the process of identifying the complexity of the model. These are applicable generally for non-deterministic models which need some form of initialization. E.g. K in the K-Means is a hyper-parameter that signifies the number of centroids to be considered in the model</li></ul> | <ul><li>What form is the data available? E.g. input/output, just input etc.?</li><li>What are the parameters in the model?</li><li>What is its relationship with the data?</li><li>Are there any initializers in the parameter or hyper-parameter? E.g. K-Means picks a random centroid at the beginning</li><li>Is there a way/automated way to determine the hyper-parameter?</li><li>What visualization can be used to compare the hyper-parameter behavior? e.g. Silhouette Score</li><li>Is the model functional or Non-parametric? As the name suggests Non-parametric methods donâ€™t have any input parameter</li></ul> |
| Deterministic or Non-deterministic | <ul><li>Deterministic models provide the same output for same input data. E.g. Linear regression out will always be the same given the input data is same</li><li>Non-deterministic models may give a different output for the same data based on the initialization? E.g. K-Means picks the centroid randomly, hence has no guarantee of providing the same output</li></ul> | <ul><li>Is the model deterministic or non-deterministic?</li><li>What initializers impact the determinism of the model?</li><li>Are there any iterative parameters used by the model? E.g. K-Means uses n number of iterations before arriving at the model. This is also a representation of the complexity of the model</li></ul> |
| Bias or Variance | <ul><li>Bias comes from inherent assumptions that we make during model identification. E.g. assuming that the data distribution is linear can create huge bias when it's not</li><li>Variance is a factor of the precision that we try to bring in the model based on the available data. E.g. we can overfit a model on the sample data but the variance can be huge on the unseen data</li></ul> | <ul><li>Does the model have a functional form?</li><li>How is the model identified from the solution space?</li><li>What constraints are assumed in the model that may limit the solution space?</li></ul> |
| Hard or Smooth Association | <ul><li>Hard association generally associates a data with a single class. E.g. K-Means or K-Nearest Neighbor</li><li>Smooth association as the name suggests, gives a probability of affinity to belong to a particular class. E.g. Parzen Window or Gaussian Mixture Model</li></ul> | <ul><li>Does the model do hard or smooth association?</li><li>Are there alternative to the model if identified in one or the other category?</li></ul> |
| Function and Distribution | <ul><li>A model can be described with the function which is either the representation of the data or a way to discriminate the boundaries in the data</li><li>Distribution is a representation of the density of the data</li></ul> | <ul><li>What is the functional form of the data?</li><li>What is the derivation of the functional form?</li><li>How does the distribution plot of the function generally looks like?</li><li>Is there a way to identify the functional form given the data?</li></ul> |
| Objective Function & Derivation | <ul><li>Each model is essentially an objective function that is optimized based on the available data to often determine the parameters in it</li></ul> | <ul><li>What is the objective function of the model?</li><li>What method was used for optimization of the objective functions? OLS, MLE etc.</li><li>What is the loss function for this model?</li><li>What is the derivation of the objective function?</li></ul> |
| Complexity | <ul><li>Simply put, the set of steps required to reach to the most optimized model based on the input data. This can be a factor of the number of dimensions, number of possible values in each dimension, number of iterations in non-deterministic models, no of hyper-parameters to be tried before finding the optimized model</li></ul> | <ul><li>What is the representation based on the dimensions, dimension domain values, iterations, hyper-parameter etc.?</li><li>How to visualize the point of inflection for the complexity and purity of the solution. E.g. K-Means can result in hypo, hyper or optimized clustering based on various values of hyper-parameter K </li></ul> |
| Purity | <ul><li>Purity reflects the effectiveness of the model generally on the unseen data. E.g. do all data points assigned to a cluster really belong to that cluster? What is the % association measured against the entire data in that cluster?</li></ul> | <ul><li>How do you measure the accuracy of the model?</li><li>What are the available methods to determine this?</li><li>
What is the point of inflection? E.g. there can be a point of inflection between the relevance of the search results vs completeness of them which can be measured in the form of precision and recall.</li></ul> |
| Supervised or Un-supervised | <ul><li>Supervised models are trained on a labelled data set to make a prediction (quantitative or categorical)</li><li>Un-supervised models help understand the structure of the data without any prior information or training</li></ul> | <ul><li>Does the model need to predict an outcome or understand the structure of data?</li><li>What is the data required for training of this model?</li><li>What parameters this model is trained for, that will be used for prediction?</li></ul> |
