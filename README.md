# Applied Machine Learning
This repository intends to capture the learnings from my own experience of data science in various scenarios. Newer topics will be be added here on a continuous basis, however let's start with the basics

[Model Exploration Framework](https://github.com/jovinod/applied_machine_learning/blob/master/model_exploration/ModelExploration.md)
List a large number of parameters to take into account and explore while learning a new modelling technique

[Linear Regression](https://github.com/jovinod/applied_machine_learning/blob/master/README.md)
Coming Soon: Based on the parameters scpecified in [Model Exploration Framework](https://github.com/jovinod/applied_machine_learning/blob/master/model_exploration/ModelExploration.md), a detailed description of linear regression
