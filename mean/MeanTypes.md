## Arithmetic Mean
* When dealing with items that are not compounded or in a ratio, then you use Arithmetic Mean. This can be weighted or non-weighted. Weighted Mean gives different weights to the observations or gives different likelihood to observation
* Formula = (x1 + x2 + x3+ …… xn)/n
* Example - finding the average age of a group of people

## Geometric Mean
* When you are dealing with attributes that are compounded, then Geometric mean comes into play.
* Formula = UNDEROOT(power of n)(x1 * x2 * x3 * …… xn)
* Example - dealing with %rate of interest year on year and trying to find out the mean rate of interest per year

## Harmonic Mean
* When you are dealing with attributes in ratios, then Harmonic mean comes into play
* Formula = n/(1/x1 + 1/x2 + 1/x3 + ……. 1/xn)
* Example - finding the average speed across multiple speeds or F ratio which is a mean of precision and recall, which itself are ratios
